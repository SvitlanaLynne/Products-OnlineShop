# Products - Online Shop Sample

Welcome to the "Products" project, a basic online shop built with React!

## Key Features

This project showcases a basic online shop built with React. It includes the following features:

1. Home and Product Details pages with components like logos, buttons, and icons.
2. Fetching and displaying product data from an API in a table format.
3. Implementation of sorting and filtering capabilities.
4. Utilization of routing for navigation between pages.
5. Styling with the Tailwind css framework.

The primary goal of the "products" project was to enhance my Frontend coding skills. I also gained a valuable practice in testing, environment setup, and version control.
