# products - online shop sample

This project showcases a basic online shop built with React. It includes the following features:

1. Different pages with components like logos, buttons, and panels.
2. Fetching and displaying product data from an API in a table format.
3. Implementation of sorting and filtering capabilities.
4. Utilization of routing for seamless navigation between pages.

The primary goal of the "products" project was to enhance Frontend coding skills. It also provided practice in testing, environment setup, and version control.
